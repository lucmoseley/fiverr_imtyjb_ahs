Design information system
Develop information system in Python:
- must have layers that include:
    - data layer -- communicates with database and makes data available on request
    - interface layer -- interfaces with the data layer via a GUI
    - validation code that can be plugged into the GUI
- all layers must include "test methods" that ensure code is operating correctly 
Generate "analysis and design" documentation
